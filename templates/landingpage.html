            <br>
            <br> 
            2) Playlist analysis - all songs in 1 selected user playlist will be pulled into a radar and line chart,
            to visually examine patterns in playlist construction

            <br> 
            3) Beta Functionality: the model will retrieve the user's top recent tracks and build a pool of recommendations.
            The model will then fit the recommendations to a 'curve' and present the complete set as a playlist in Spotify

            <p>
            This tool will ask you for Spotify Authentication to create new playlists. No playlists will be deleted.
